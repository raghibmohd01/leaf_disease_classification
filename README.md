Plant disease is a major threat in the agriculture field. Disease detection at an earlier stage in
plants is a time- consuming and tedious process when it is done manually. But with the
development of AI and deep learning, it is less time consuming and a much easier process.
Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system based on Deep Learning.
Compared to the traditional plant disease detection systems, this methodology consumes less
time and furnishes results with increasing accuracy with every execution.



Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is
vulnerable to virus diseases. Cassava is Africa’s most crucial staple crop, and second-largest
producer of carbohydrates in the continent. It is a major source of calories for two out of every
five Africans. Cassava crop is grown by small farmers because it can withstand harsh
conditions. It provides sufficient yields in low soil fertility and doesn't require much water.
Cassava is eaten in many parts of India as well. Cultivated in about 13 states of India, mostly in
south Indian states. Major industrial crop in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Existing methods
of disease detection require farmers to depend on agricultural experts to visually inspect and
diagnose the plants. At present, in order to know whether one plant has disease or not, farmers
must go to agricultural experts to inspect the plants in person. Unfortunately, this process is
extremely labor intensive, slow, and inefficient. To help speed up this process and provide
farmers with the best opportunity to save their crops. Our goal is to develop a convolutional
neural network which will be able to quickly and accurately classify whether a given plant is
suffering from a disease or not by simply providing the model with an image of that plant’s
leaves.


Our objective is to build a Deep Learning based plant disease detection model that will help and
support the agricultural department in detecting the diseased crop in the early stages and control
the recrudescing diseases. Deep learning’s self-learning concept and processing on unstructured
data will reduce the manual dependency for identification of crop disease diagnosis. The
diseased crops will be detected from the outward physical appearance, which shows up the
symptoms of physiological abnormality. The purpose is to deliver an advanced technique to
achieve high accuracy, cost effective and robust disease prediction systems.
